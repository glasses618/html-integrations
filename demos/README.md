# Demos integration

Some kind of esplanation 

## Quick start

First you have to install all the project dependencies on the root folder:

```sh
$ npm i
```

To run a demo, go on the desired editor folder and run, to init the editor:

```sh
$ npm i
$ npm run deploy
```

If you want to build a development enviorment, you must link packages of the mono-repositoy on your local directoy. Also, every time, a package is modified, it has to be compiled. To do this, run:

```sh
$ npm i
$ npm run build-dev
```

Hint: The commant "npm i" it's just necessary the first time you initialyze an editor.
